# ReactCRUD ðŸ“š
Very basic CRUD App using React for frontend, FastAPI for backend, and MongoDB for the database.

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as boilerplate code for me to copy when making web applications.

Each folders `/frontend` and `/backend` have their own README files that tell you how to run each respective part of the webapp.
